### Welcome to Tumour Immunodynamics (TIDY) Research Group at UCL Cancer Institute

### Group Leader: Dr James Reading

Our research focuses on deciphering the progressive dysregulation of tissue resident and systemic CD4 and CD8 T cell responses to mutation encoded neoantigens from health to death, in several unique clinical cohorts representing a range of cancer types. By longitudinally profiling neoantigen-reactive T cells at the functional, transcriptional, phenotypic and epigenetic level we aim to discern novel biomarkers and actionable T cell-intrinsic targets to inform future preventative and therapeutic immuno-oncology regimens

We recently discovered a program of neoantigen-driven intra-tumoural T cell dysfunction in primary non-small lung cancer (NSCLC), characterised by a tumour-mutational burden (TMB)-dependent conversion of progenitor (TCF1+) to exhausted (TOX+PD1hi) T cell subsets. We found that neoantigen-driven T cell dysfunction  (Neo-Dys) defines adverse clinical outcomes in multiple cancers, consistent with a common pathway of fatal immune failure.
